# Congress Changes

Simple Twitter bot for tracking changes to accounts that are a part of the [Tweets of Congress site](https://github.com/alexlitel/congresstweets) project. It's pretty much built for the specific use case of interacting with the Redis data store from the [backend portion of the Tweets of Congress project](https://github.com/alexlitel/congresstweets-automator).
